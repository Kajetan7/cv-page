# My public repos


## [cv-page](https://github.com/Kajetan7/cv-page)
Source code for this site, built with MkDocs. Super simple to maintain, with a local test environment powered by Docker. Pushing changes and letting automation handle building and shipping images to the container registry for easy deployment. Casual, clean, and cloud-ready.

**Technologies:** MkDocs, Docker, GitHub Actions

**Status:** In progress



## [homelab-infra](https://github.com/Kajetan7/homelab-infra)
Codebase for running the web app that hosts this site, plus a k3s cluster on Azure VMs. The cluster is my playground for experiments and learningâ€”always evolving and under active development. Planned stack includes Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Helm, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Istio.

**Technologies:** Azure, Terraform, Shell (and more coming soon)

**Status:** In progress

**Close plans:**
- Build a small internal developer platform
- Play around with Qiskit


## [prosport_service](https://github.com/Kajetan7/pro-sport_SERVICE)
A calendar and scheduler app for planning bike repairs in a bike service shop. The project is currently on hold due to other priorities, but it's a neat solution for managing service appointments and workflow.
